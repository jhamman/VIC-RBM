# VIC-RBM
Grid-based macro scale temperature model. A  grid-based stream temperature model driven by the forcings from VIC simulations
and routed flows from the Lohmann routing model.  The model uses an efficient, semi-Lagrangian particle tracking scheme to
simulate time-dependent, cross-sectionally averaged stream  temperatures over a broad spectrum of spatial scales.  The
theoretical background, as well as example applications are described in the following publications:
